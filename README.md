Deliberable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program before their retirement. Also to prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" as a large number of employees are reaching their retariement age. PostgreSQL was utilized to conduct this analysis.

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
