Deliberable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Also to prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" as a large number of employees are reaching their retariement age.

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


The following data was gathered during the analysis to determine which employees were reaching retirement and eligible for the mentorship program. For example employees born between 1952-01-01 and 1955-12-31 and hired between 1982-01-01 and 1985-12-31 were the targetted employees. Also staff born in 1965 were targeted for mentorship program. Furthermore the findings present: 

- Employees appraoching retirement: 41380
- Eligible for mentorship program: 1550
- Senior staff: 28254
- Senior engineers: 29414
- Number managers that need be replaced: 2

Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

From the 90,398 possible positions opening because of retirement, there are only 1,550 employees currently at Pewlett-Hackard eligible to mentor the upcoming employees to fill these positions. To be more precise the analysis shows that there is only 741 senior staff eligible to mentor 57,668 vacancies. There would be 1 seior staff for every 77 new upcoming staff. 

However, if the age cirteria for mentoriship program was widened beyond 1965, it would increase our chances of finding enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the department who are also interested in participating in the mentorship program. For instance if age requirement changed to 1962-1965, there would be 1 mentor for every 1.6 new staff or 1 senior staff for every 2.3 new staff. By widening the eligiblity cirteria the mentorship program can succeed and become very beneficial for the success of the company. It will ensure every new staff would be mentored and mentored well in smaller groups.
