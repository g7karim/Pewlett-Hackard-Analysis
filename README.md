Deliberable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program before their retirement. Also to prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" as a large number of employees are reaching their retariement age. PostgreSQL was utilized to conduct this analysis.

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


The following data was gathered during the analysis to determine which employees were reaching retirement and eligible for the mentorship program. For example employees born between 1952-01-01 and 1955-12-31 and hired between 1982-01-01 and 1985-12-31 were the targetted employees. Furthermore the findings present: 

- Employees appraoching retirement: 41380
- Eligible for mentorship program: 1550
- Senior staff: 28254
- Senior engineers: 29414
- Number managers that need be replaced: 2 



Determining the eligiblity critteria for staff born in 1965:

- 1,550 employees eligible for the mentorship program

There are no managers eligible for this program based on the current criteriaSummary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Looking at both of these analyses, we can see that of the 90,396 potential spaces that need to be filled due to retirement, there are only 1,550 employees currently eligible to mentor new employees to fill those positions. That means there is one mentor for every 58 new employees. More importantly, there is only 741 senior level employees eligible to mentor 57,668 vacancies. That means there is one senior level mentor for every 77 new senior level employee.

If we change to criteria for the mentorship program to employees born between 1962 and 1965 those numbers drop to one mentor for every 1.6 new employees and one senior level mentor for every 2.3 new senior level employees. By widening the pool of eligible employees this program has a strong chance at not only surviving, but thriving. More employees will be incentized to mentor if they are only mentoring 2 to 3 people instead of 50+ people. Also, new employees will gain more from one on one mentoring compared to group mentoring that would likely happen in the first situation. While not everyone will want to praticipate in this program, the more current employees who are eligible to better to see this program succeed.
